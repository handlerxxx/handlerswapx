[AleoSwap](https://aleoswap.org) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Aleo blockchain, utilizing the Uniswap mechanism. It leverages the unique features of the Aleo blockchain to offer enhanced privacy and new functionalities to both the DEX and its users.

We are currently undergoing rapid iteration. Some of the optimizations and new features may require Aleo(snarkVM, aleo lang) to provide additional features and support before they can be implemented.

## Functions

### create_token

`create_token` is used to create a new token.

Function:
```rust
create_token(public info: TokenInfo)
```

Params:
- `info: TokenInfo`: a struct including token name, symbol, decimals and total_supply

  ```go
  struct TokenInfo {
      name: field,
      symbol: field,
      decimals: u8,
      total_supply: u128,
      admin: address,
  }
  ```
- We need to convert `name` and `symbol` string directly to bytes array and then to field (integer) type.
  e.g. `USDT -> 1431520340field`.
- The admin can perform some special operations on the token, like `set_token_faucet`.

Command:
```sh
# Create a new token: name=USDT, symbol=USDT, decimals=6, total_supply=1e8*1e6, admin=$admin_addr
snarkos developer execute -q $rpc_url -b $broadcast_url -p $private_key -r $fee_record \
  $program_id create_token "{name: 1431520340field, symbol: 1431520340field, decimals: 6u8, total_supply: 100000000000000u128, admin: $admin_addr}"

### create_pair

`create_pair` is used to create a new pair and add initial liquidity.
- A pair must be created through this function (or `create_pair_privately`) before subsequent liquidity and swap operations can be performed.
- Each pair is also a standard token (called liquidity pool token or LP token) created automatically when the pair is created,
  and its token_id is the same as pair_id: `lp_token_id = pair_id = bhp256_hash({token_a: field, token_b: field})`.
- This function can only be used to add initial liquidity, further liquidity additions require calling the `add_liquidity` function.
- The caller's token_a and token_b will be transferred to the program, and LP tokens will be minted to the `to` address.

Function:
```rust
create_pair(
    public token_a: field,
    public token_b: field,
    public amount_a: u128,
    public amount_b: u128,

    private pt_b: PrivateToken,
    public amount_a: u128,
    public amount_b: u128,
    private to: address,
    public liquidity: u128,

```

Params:
